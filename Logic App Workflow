# Logic App Workflow Design

## Designing the Workflow
1. Navigate to Azure Logic Apps.
2. Click on **+ Add** to create a new Logic App.
3. Fill in the necessary details (e.g., Logic App Name, Resource Group, Location).
4. Click **Review + create**, then **Create** to finalize the setup.
5. Assign the Logic App Contributor role to give Azure Resource Manager permissions:
   - Navigate to your subscription in the Azure portal.
   - Select **Access control (IAM)** on the left-hand menu.
   - Click on **+ Add role assignment**.
   - In the **Role** dropdown, select **Logic App Contributor**.
   - In the **Assign access to** dropdown, select **Logic App**.
   - Search for and select your Logic App.
   - Click **Save** to assign the role. This step is crucial to ensure your Logic App has the necessary permissions to manage resources via Azure Resource Manager.
6. Open your new Logic App and click on **Edit**.
7. Design your workflow by adding the necessary triggers and actions:
   - **Trigger:** When a new email arrives (V3).
   - **Actions:** Add actions to the workflow to automate the onboarding process. These actions can include:
     1. **Initialize Variable:** Initialize variables for different purposes such as setting up the `mailNickname`, extracting HTML from the email address, configuring the principal name, and preparing the display name.
     2. **Set Variable:** Set the initialized variables with the appropriate values.
     3. **Compose:** Use the Compose action to format and store data such as the given name, surname, full name, mail nickname, and principal name.
     4. **Create user:** Creating a new user account.
     5. **Add user to group:** Adding the new user to a specific group.
     6. **Create or update a template deployment:** Use Azure Resource Manager to add the user to a working resource group, which could contain access to resources like virtual machines.
     7. **Send Email (V3):** Sending an email to notify the new employee and provide them with login information.

### Best Practices
- **Modular Design:** Break down your workflow into modular components for easier maintenance and updates.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling actions to manage any issues that arise during the workflow.
- **Monitoring:** Use Azure Monitor and Logic App run history to track the performance and success of your workflows
